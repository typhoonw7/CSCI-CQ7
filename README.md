# CSCI-CQ7
Running Time of Algorithm: 
  Time Complexity: O(n^2), since there are two loops in the function. The worse case scenario, the function will run through every cases. 
  Space Complexity: O(1)
Ice Cream Parlor(DP):
  Definition of Recursive: It 's the algorithm that repeatedly call the function itself. It break a complex code into smaller and simplier checking through the base case. It also prevent infinite loops.
